{"role": "model", "content": "Here are a couple of powerful things you can do in Marp to make your slides look professional:\n\n### 1. Split Slides (Image + Text)\nYou can easily split a slide so an image takes up one side (left or right) and your text takes up the other. This is great for minimizing bullet-point fatigue.\n\nUse the `bg` keyword in the image syntax, followed by `left` or `right` and a percentage size.\n\n**Syntax:**\n```markdown\n![bg right:40%](images/my-diagram.png)\n\n# This is the Title\n- This text appears on the left (60%).\n- The image appears on the right (40%).\n```\n\n### 2. Slide-Specific Styling\nSometimes you want one slide to look different (e.g., a dark title slide or a \"Quote\" slide). You can apply classes or styles just to the *current* slide using an underscore `_`.\n\n**Example: Invert colors for a dramatic transition**\n```markdown\n<!-- _class: invert -->\n\n# This Slide is Dark\nWhite text on a black background.\n```\n\n**Example: Remove page number for the title slide**\n```markdown\n<!-- _paginate: false -->\n\n# Title Slide\nNo page number here.\n```\n\nWould you like to try applying any of these to your current BERT presentation?"}
