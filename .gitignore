# Vibe Presentation specific
# Ignore the user's local presentation storage if they use the default location in the repo
# But we might want to keep 'presentations/' if it contains the demo? 
# The user said "A clean demo project". 
# Let's ignore specific user decks if we can, or just ignore the drafts/images generated during runs.
# For now, standard python ignores + .env is the critical part.
